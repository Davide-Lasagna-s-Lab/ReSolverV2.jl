# Space-time formulation

This page sets up the problem solved by ReSolverV2: the search for a periodic or relative periodic
orbit written as the zero of a residual over space and time, and the objects from which both search
methods are built.

## Periodic and relative periodic orbits

Consider a dynamical system

```math
\partial_t u = N(u) \tag{1}
```

for a field ``u(x', t)`` that depends on the spatial coordinates ``x'`` of the fixed frame and on
time. For brevity the notation shows a single variable ``x'``, but the method applies to any number
of spatial coordinates, and to ordinary differential equations, which have none. Suppose that
``N`` is equivariant under translations along some of the coordinates, the directions ``x'_i``: if
``u`` is a solution, so is its translate ``\tau_\ell u = u(x' + \ell, t)``, with ``\ell = (\ell_i)``
a shift along those directions. In a channel flow these are the streamwise and spanwise directions;
in a pipe, the axial and azimuthal ones; for the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation on a periodic
domain, the only spatial direction.

A *periodic orbit* is a solution that repeats after a period ``T``,

```math
u(x', t + T) = u(x', t) . \tag{2}
```

Because of the symmetry, a solution may instead repeat only up to a translation ``\ell_i`` along
the symmetry directions: a *relative periodic orbit*,

```math
u(x', t + T) = u(x' + \ell, t) . \tag{3}
```

It is periodic in a frame moving with the drift speeds ``c_i = -\ell_i/T``, of coordinates

```math
x = x' - c\,t . \tag{4}
```

## Rescaled time and the residual

Express the solution in the moving coordinates ``x`` and in the *rescaled time*
``s = \omega t \in [0, 2\pi)``, with ``\omega = 2\pi/T`` the frequency, keeping the symbol ``u``:
in the new variables ``u = u(x, s)`` is periodic in ``s`` with period ``2\pi``, whatever the period
``T`` of the orbit, and by the chain rule the time derivative becomes

```math
\partial_t \;\longrightarrow\; \omega\,\partial_s - \sum_i c_i\,\partial_i , \tag{5}
```

with ``\partial_i`` the derivative along ``x_i``. Equation (1) becomes the *space-time residual*

```math
r(u, \omega, c) \;=\; \omega\,\partial_s u \;-\; \sum_i c_i\,\partial_i u \;-\; N(u) \;=\; 0 , \tag{6}
```

where, by equivariance, ``N`` acts in the moving frame as in the fixed one. Periodic orbits are the
case ``c = 0``, for which the two frames coincide. Only directions of translational symmetry can
carry a drift, and a further symmetry of the solution can forbid even some of those (see
[Search by root finding](@ref)): the drift directions are chosen by the user.

The whole orbit is represented at once. The period is no longer an integration time, as in a
shooting method, but an unknown, like the drift speeds; no time integration is ever performed, so
the exponential amplification of errors along an unstable orbit, which limits shooting methods to
short or weakly unstable orbits, never arises.

## Space-time fields

The unknown field is an element of the space

```math
\mathcal{U} = \big\{\, u(x, s) \ :\ u \text{ real, } 2\pi\text{-periodic in } s \,\big\} \tag{7}
```

of space-time fields over the spatial domain and one period of rescaled time, with the boundary
conditions of the problem and periodicity along the symmetry directions. ``\mathcal{U}`` carries the
inner product

```math
\langle u, v\rangle = \frac{1}{2\pi\,|\Omega|} \int_0^{2\pi} \!\! \int_\Omega u(x, s)\, v(x, s)\;
\mathrm{d}x\, \mathrm{d}s , \tag{8}
```

with ``\Omega`` the spatial domain, or any discretisation of it, and the norm
``\lVert u\rVert^2 = \langle u, u\rangle``. The residual (6) maps a field and the parameters to a
field, ``r : \mathcal{U} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathcal{U}``, with ``m`` the
number of drift directions.

## Unknowns

The frequency enters through its logarithm,

```math
\rho = \log\omega, \qquad \omega = e^{\rho} . \tag{9}
```

``\omega`` stays positive whatever the step, and a step in ``\rho`` is a relative change of the
frequency, so that its scale does not depend on the period of the orbit. The unknowns form an
[`Orbit`](@ref), ``p = (u, \rho, c_1, \dots, c_m)``, an element of the space
``\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{U} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^m``. For two orbits
``p = (u, \rho, c)`` and ``q = (v, \varrho, e)`` the inner product is

```math
\langle p, q\rangle = \langle u, v\rangle + \rho\,\varrho + \sum_i c_i\, e_i , \tag{10}
```

where ``\langle u, v\rangle`` is the inner product (8) of ``\mathcal{U}``. A discretisation with
``N_u`` real degrees of freedom for the field has ``N_u + 1 + m`` unknowns.

## Space-time operators

Both methods are built from five operators on ``\mathcal{U}``. They act on a whole orbit at once,
mapping a space-time field to a space-time field:

- ``N : \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{U}``, the *nonlinear operator*: the right-hand side of (1)
  extended to space-time fields.
- ``L\{u_0\} : \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{U}``, the *linearised operator* about a point
  ``u_0 \in \mathcal{U}``, the derivative of ``N`` there:

```math
N(u_0 + \delta u) = N(u_0) + L\{u_0\}\,\delta u + O(\lVert \delta u\rVert^2) . \tag{11}
```

  The braces mark the dependence on ``u_0``, the *linearisation point*, which the methods set
  before using the operator. In the following, ``L`` without braces is taken about the current
  orbit ``u``.
- ``L^+\{u_0\} : \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{U}``, the *adjoint* of ``L\{u_0\}`` in the inner product
  of ``\mathcal{U}``, defined by ``\langle v, L\{u_0\}\, w\rangle = \langle L^+\{u_0\}\, v, w\rangle``
  for all ``v, w \in \mathcal{U}``.
- ``\partial_s : \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{U}``, the derivative in rescaled time. On the Fourier
  coefficients of ``u`` in ``s`` it multiplies the mode ``n`` by ``\mathrm{i}\,n``.
- ``\partial_i : \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{U}``, the derivative along the drift direction ``x_i`` of
  the moving frame. On the Fourier coefficients it multiplies the mode of wavenumber ``k_i`` by
  ``\mathrm{i}\,k_i``.

**Skew-adjointness of the derivatives.** The two derivatives have a property that the methods rely
on: they are *skew-adjoint* in the inner product of ``\mathcal{U}``,

```math
\langle \partial u, v\rangle = -\langle u, \partial v\rangle
\quad \text{for all } u, v \in \mathcal{U}, \qquad \partial = \partial_s \text{ or } \partial_i , \tag{12}
```

i.e. each derivative is its own adjoint up to a sign, ``\partial^+ = -\partial``. In the continuous
setting this is integration by parts: along ``s``,

```math
\int_0^{2\pi} \partial_s u\; v \,\mathrm{d}s
= \big[\, u\, v \,\big]_0^{2\pi} - \int_0^{2\pi} u\; \partial_s v \,\mathrm{d}s
= - \int_0^{2\pi} u\; \partial_s v \,\mathrm{d}s ,
```

where the boundary term vanishes because the fields are periodic in ``s``; along a drift direction
the argument is the same, the fields being periodic along every direction of translational
symmetry. Equivalently, in Fourier, ``\partial`` multiplies each mode by an imaginary number,
``\mathrm{i}\,n`` or ``\mathrm{i}\,k_i``, whose complex conjugate is its opposite.

**Why it matters.** The gradient used by L-BFGS ([Search by optimisation](@ref)) is obtained by
moving the derivatives off the variation ``\delta u`` and onto the residual ``r`` with (12): a term
``\langle r, \omega\,\partial_s\delta u\rangle`` of the variation of ``\tfrac12\lVert r\rVert^2``
becomes ``\langle -\omega\,\partial_s r, \delta u\rangle``, which identifies
``-\omega\,\partial_s r`` as a contribution to the gradient. The methods, though, work with the
*discretised* problem: the fields are vectors of numbers, ``\partial`` is a matrix ``D``, and the
inner product is a weighted sum. The formula for the gradient is the exact gradient of the discrete
``\tfrac12\lVert r\rVert^2`` only if (12) holds for ``D`` and the discrete inner product as an
algebraic identity, ``\langle D u, v\rangle = -\langle u, D v\rangle`` for every pair of discrete
fields, up to rounding errors. It is not enough that ``D`` approximates a skew-adjoint operator to
the order of the discretisation: an error of order ``h^q`` in (12) makes the computed gradient differ
from the true one by a term of the same order, which does not vanish at the minimum. Close to a
solution, where the true gradient is small, this error dominates, the search direction is no longer
a descent direction, and the line search fails. This is the meaning of *exactly* in the
requirements of the package: an identity of the discrete operators, to rounding, not an
approximation that improves with the resolution.

Which discretisations satisfy it:

- Fourier derivatives on an odd number of points: every mode ``n`` is paired with ``-n``, and the
  derivative is a multiplication by ``\mathrm{i}\,n`` on each pair. With an even number the Nyquist
  mode has no partner, its derivative must be set to zero, and operators built from the derivatives
  become inconsistent (the second derivative no longer equals the square of the first); odd sizes
  avoid the question.
- Central finite differences on a uniform periodic grid, with the inner product the mean over the
  grid points: their matrices are skew-symmetric.
- Not one-sided differences, nor central differences on a non-uniform grid with an unweighted inner
  product.

The same holds for the adjoint operator ``L^+``: it must be the exact adjoint of the discrete
linearised operator in the discrete inner product, the transpose of its matrix up to the weights of
the inner product, not a discretisation of the continuous adjoint. The two differ by discretisation
errors, for instance through aliasing or the treatment of products, and only the first gives an
exact gradient. Newton's method needs neither property: the hookstep uses only the actions of
``L``, ``\partial_s`` and ``\partial_i``. The [Usage](@ref) page lists checks of both properties.

The user provides the five operators as functions, together with the inner product of the fields;
the search uses nothing else about the system (see [Usage](@ref)).
