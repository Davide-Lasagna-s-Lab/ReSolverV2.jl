module ReSolverV2

# Space-time search for periodic and relative periodic orbits of a dynamical system ∂t a = N(a),
#
#     r(a, ω, c) = ω ∂s a - Σᵢ cᵢ ∂ᵢ a - N(a) = 0,
#
# with space-time field a, frequency ω = 2π/T, rescaled time s ∈ [0, 2π) and drift speeds cᵢ along
# directions of translational symmetry. Two methods share one residual:
#
#     LBFGS            minimise ½‖r‖² with L-BFGS, gradient from the adjoint operator
#     NewtonHookstep   solve r = 0 with Newton–Krylov hookstep, Jacobian from the linearised operator
#
# The operators N, L and L⁺ and the derivatives are given by the user, as functions; the
# examples/ folder has the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation and the Lorenz system.
# L-BFGS (from ResolverOptimAlgorithms) and the Arnoldi iteration (from GMRES.jl) are local
# copies, free to be adapted.
